  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Rishan Ratha</p>

  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>
    Build a clear, trustworthy website for <strong>100SMILES Dental Care</strong> that increases new-patient bookings
    and email enquiries by <strong>20% within 3 months</strong>. The site will make it easy to contact the clinic,
    understand services, and feel confident about the team—leading to more completed preventive check-ups and
    cleanings.
  </p>

  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    The site will be judged successful if, over the first 12 weeks:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bookings:</strong> ≥20% increase in first-visit bookings (measured via email bookings and phone calls originating from the site).</li>
    <li><strong>Enquiries:</strong> ≥20% increase in contact emails compared to the previous 12 weeks.</li>
    <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> ≥60% of visitors view both “Our Team” and “Contact Us” pages in a session.</li>
    <li><strong>Usability:</strong> ≥80% positive feedback from a quick patient survey (clarity, trust, ease of finding contact info).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Primary audiences:</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Families in Razole</strong> seeking routine dental care (check-ups/cleanings) and emergency support.</li>
    <li><strong>Working adults & seniors</strong> wanting reliable, friendly care and clear pricing/offers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Design to serve this audience:</strong> Calm, clinical colours (soft blues/white) to signal hygiene and trust;
    large readable headings; simple 3-item navigation (<em>Home</em>, <em>Our Team</em>, <em>Contact Us</em>);
    prominent phone/email; photos that show compassionate care; concise copy with benefits and current offers.
  </p>

  <h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
  <p>
    The site is intentionally small and focused:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Home</strong> → overview, key services, offers, CTA to contact</li>
    <li><strong>Our Team</strong> → dentist profiles and roles to build trust</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Us</strong> → phone, email, address, hours, offers reminder</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
